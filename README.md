# MG-Portfolio
My Personal Portfolio

This is my personal Portfolio, I built this via YouTube tutorial, most of it is not my or built from scratch by me however there were few rendering bugs I had to fix 
on in front and back-end and change bits and bobs to suit me like implementing Send Email form and other things which were not easy and by trying to fix and change
stuff has tought me quit a bit of new things about front-end and back-end of web development.
